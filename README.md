# ICP-Questionnaire
Development of a Survey Solutions questionnaire template for the International Comparison Program (ICP).

Survey Solutions Designer is located here: 
https://designer.mysurvey.solutions .
Access is open to public and free (no cost).

Anyone who intends to modify a Survey Solutions questionnaire must register and do such edits in the Designer tool.

A data server is needed for actual data collection. The following pages in the Survey Solutions documentation explain the setup:

- https://docs.mysurvey.solutions/headquarters/config/server-setup/
- https://docs.mysurvey.solutions/faq/server-requirements/
- https://docs.mysurvey.solutions/headquarters/config/server-installation/

Deployment is possible to a local server or to a cloud. Cloud deployments are recommended. Specific instructions are available for:
- Amazon AWS: https://docs.mysurvey.solutions/headquarters/config/aws-setup/
- Microsoft Azure: https://docs.mysurvey.solutions/headquarters/config/azure-setup/

The questionnaire is a template. It does not carry any actual items, the prices of which are tracked.
It is recommended to edit/finalize/retest the template for the actual client and survey plan.
