# ICP-Questionnaire
Development of a Survey Solutions questionnaire template for the International Comparison Program (ICP).

Anyone who intends to modify a Survey Solutions questionnaire must have an account and do such edits in the [Designer](https://designer.mysurvey.solutions) tool. Access is open to public and free (no cost). Users may self-register. 

A data server is needed for actual data collection. The following pages in the Survey Solutions documentation explain the setup:

- [Survey Solutions server](https://docs.mysurvey.solutions/headquarters/config/server-setup/)
- [Survey Solutions server hosting](https://docs.mysurvey.solutions/faq/cloud-server-request/)
- [Server requirements](https://docs.mysurvey.solutions/faq/server-requirements/)
- [Server installation](https://docs.mysurvey.solutions/headquarters/config/server-installation/)

Deployment is possible to a local server or to a cloud. Cloud deployments are recommended. Specific instructions are available for:
- [Amazon AWS](https://docs.mysurvey.solutions/headquarters/config/aws-setup/)
- [Microsoft Azure](https://docs.mysurvey.solutions/headquarters/config/azure-setup/)

The questionnaire is a template. It does not carry any actual items, the prices of which are tracked.
It is recommended to edit/finalize/retest the template for the actual client and survey plan.
