# Server

A data server is needed for actual data collection. The following pages in the Survey Solutions documentation 
explain the setup:

- [Survey Solutions server](https://docs.mysurvey.solutions/headquarters/config/server-setup/)
- [Survey Solutions server hosting](https://docs.mysurvey.solutions/faq/cloud-server-request/)
- [Server requirements](https://docs.mysurvey.solutions/faq/server-requirements/)
- [Server installation](https://docs.mysurvey.solutions/headquarters/config/server-installation/)

Deployment is possible to a local server or to a cloud. Cloud deployments are recommended. Specific 
instructions are available for:

- [Amazon AWS](https://docs.mysurvey.solutions/headquarters/config/aws-setup/)
- [Microsoft Azure](https://docs.mysurvey.solutions/headquarters/config/azure-setup/)

[Personal demonstration servers](https://docs.mysurvey.solutions/headquarters/config/personal-demo-server/) 
are available for checking the functionality of the software. They should not be used for collecting actual 
data.
